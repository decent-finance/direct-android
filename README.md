## Before you start

Please note, that this library requires `minSdkVersion` to be at least `21`. This library also requires `AndroidX`.

## Installation

Add the following repository to your `build.gradle`

```gradle
maven {	url  'https://dl.bintray.com/decent-finance/direct-android' }
```

Also add these repositories so that required dendencies are properly resolved

```gradle
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/shopify/shopify-android' }
```

Add the following dependency to your module-level `buld.gradle`

```
implementation "com.cexdirect:lib:$someVersion"
```

Available versions are listed [here](https://bintray.com/beta/#/decent-finance/direct-android/com.cexdirect.lib?tab=overview).

You'll also need to enable Data Binding for your project
```gradle
android {
    // ...

    dataBinding {
        enabled true
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Setup

In your `Application` class place the following code

```kotlin
class SomeApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        // ...
        // Other code
        // ...
        Direct.credentials = Credentials("your_placement_id", "your_placement_secret")
    }
}
```

To start Direct call
```kotlin
Direct.startDirect()
```
somewhere in your app. Please note, that library currenly checks that provided credentials are not blank and will throw `Exception` in case this check fails. This behavior may change in future releases. 

If you're using Java, please refer to this [sample project](https://github.com/decent-finance/direct-android-sample).

## Dependencies

This project depends on several popular 3rd-party libraries like `OkHttp` and `Retrofit`. Direct uses `AndroidX` packages and `Dagger`. These dependencies are usually updated to latest stable versions before releasing new versions of this library.
